## Data Source

- I use the `Stanford Sentiment140` data, a sentiment analysis data (positive and negative).

- Please refer to this link for the details: `https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140`

- The full version of the data consists of `1.6 million` tweets.

- But, to make it quick for everyone, I use only `100k` tweets (see `tweets_100k.csv` file).

- Half of them are positive sentiments and another half are negative sentiments.
